# react-autocompletely examples

This is a Next.js app for the examples. This library is a library of primitives
and that's hard to communicate the value of with regular docs. We need examples
and lots of them. Each folder in the `pages` directory is a page for examples
of `react-autocompletely`. We could really use help adding more and more of
these examples!

**Note**: Unfortunately there were some problems trying to import directly
from `../src`, so as a pre-build/start script we copy the `../src` to
`./other/react-autocompletely`.
