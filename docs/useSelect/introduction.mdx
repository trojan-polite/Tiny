# useSelect

The `useSelect` hook provides functionality and accessibility to a dropdown that should act as a HTML `<select>`, as described
by the corresponding [ARIA docs](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/listbox/listbox-collapsible.html).

User should be allowed to perform a selection after opening the dropdown's menu. Only one item may be selected at a time.
The widget should be built using a text label (optional but recommended), a button that toggles the menu, the menu itself
and the collection of items that belong in the menu.
